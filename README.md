House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices using regression models.  

Project Overview
- Dataset contains 12 input features and 1 output (price).
- Prices were found to be **right-skewed**, so log transformation was applied.
- Explored Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso to evaluate performance.
- Implemented feature scaling, encoding, and visualization to understand relationships.

# Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

# Key Steps
  1. preprocessing  
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  3. Handling skewed target values with `np.log1p`  
  4. Model Training (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso,SGDRegressor)  
  5. Evaluation & Visualization  


# Results
   Improving model accuracy.
